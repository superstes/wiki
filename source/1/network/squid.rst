Transparent Proxy

Routed Traffic
==============


Forwarded Traffic
=================

If you don't have the option to control the gateway/router - you may need to forward the traffic from the client itself.

Practical examples of this:
* A Cloud VPS or Root Server that is only connected to WAN
* Distributed Systems using a central proxy (*p.e. on-site at customers*)
